== Lead Time Variability

Standard deviation of lead time

Lead Time ($L$) for the $i$-th order ($L_i$), where $i = 1, 2, dots, n$ and $n$ is the number of orders

1. Mean Lead Time

Average lead time

$
mu_L = 1 / n sum_(i=1)^n L_i
$

2 Lead Time Variability

Standard deviation, dispersion of lead times around the mean

$
sigma_L = sqrt(1 / n sum_(i=1)^n (L_i - mu_L)^2)
$

3. Coefficient of Variation (CV)

Normalizes the standard deviation by the mean, allowing for comparisons across different lead times

$
"CV"_L = sigma_L / mu_L
$
