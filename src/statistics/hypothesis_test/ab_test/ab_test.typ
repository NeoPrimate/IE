*Step 1*: Problem Statement

- User Funnel (Journey)

- Success Metrics:
  - Measurable: Can the behavior be measured using collected data?
  - Attributable: Can the behavior (effect) be assigned to the treatment (cause)?
  - Sensitive: Does the metric have low variability that can distinguish the treatment from the control?
  - Timely: How long will it take?

*Step 2*: Hypothesis Testing
- Hypothesis Statement ($H_0$, $H_a$)
- Set Significance Level ($alpha$ usually 0.05)
- Set Statistical Power (usually 0.8)
- Set Minimum Detectable Effect (MD usually 1% lift)

*Step 3*: Experiment Design

- Set Randomization Unit
- Target Population
- Determine Sample Size

$
n = (16 sigma^2) / delta^2
$

Where:
  - $sigma$: sample standard deviation
  - $delta$: difference between control & measurement

- Determine Duration of Experiment 

*Step 4*: Run Experiment

*Step 5*: Validity Check

- Instrumentation Effect
- External Factors
- Selection Bias
- Sample Ratio Mismatch
- Novelty Effect
- 

*Step 6*: Interpret Results

*Step 7*: Make Decision
