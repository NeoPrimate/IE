== Bayes Theorem

$
P(A | B) = (P(B | A) dot P(A)) / P(B)
$

- $P(A)$: prior probability (initial belief about event $A$)
- $P(B | A)$: likelihood (probability of observing $B$ given that $A$ is true
- $P(B)$: marginal likelihood (overall probability of observing $B$ under all possible conditions)
- $P(A | B)$: posterior probability (updated belief after considering the evidence $B$
