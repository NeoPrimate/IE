== Probability Axioms

=== Non-Negativity

Probability of any event cannot be negative

$
P(A) â‰¥ 0
$

=== Normalization

The probability of the sample space is always 1

$
P(S) = 1
$

Where:

- $S$ is the sample space (the set of all possible outcomes)

=== Additivity

If two events are mutually exclusive (cannot happen at the same time), the probability of either occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities

$
P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B)
$
