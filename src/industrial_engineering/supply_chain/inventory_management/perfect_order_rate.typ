=== Perfect Order Rate

Measures the percentage of orders delivered to customers in full, on time, and without any damage

$
"Perfect Order Rate" = "Number of Perfect Orders" / "Total Number of Orders" times 100%
$

Where:

- *Number of Perfect Orders*: The number of orders that are delivered on time, complete, and undamaged.
- *Total Number of Orders*: The total number of orders fulfilled within a specific period.

#eg[
Suppose you received 1,000 orders over a quarter, and 900 of those orders were delivered on time, complete, and without damage.

$
"Perfect Order Rate" = 900 / 1000 times 100% = 90%
